we are returning an AppBar component from Material-UI, which is a
top-level navigation bar that typically contains the application
title and other navigation elements. The AppBar is wrapped in a
Toolbar component, which provides padding and alignment for the
child elements. Inside the Toolbar, we have a PrecisionManufacturingIcon
component, which is an icon from Material-UI's icon library, 
and a Typography component, which is used to display the application title as a heading. */}
